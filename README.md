Hi there, I'm @ngandugilbert! As an AI enthusiast and web developer, I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge in these areas. Currently, I'm honing my skills in application development and exploring new ways to integrate AI into my projects.

I'm passionate about collaborating with like-minded individuals who share my interest in these fields. Whether you have a project idea in mind or simply want to bounce ideas off each other, I'm always open to working together and learning from one another.

If you're interested in connecting with me, you can find me on Instagram at @ngandugilbert_. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hello!
